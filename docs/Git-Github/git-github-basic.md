# Git and GitHub

Let's start with the basics. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files and collaborate with others. It is used to manage the history of your code and to merge changes from different branches. Terms like version control, branches, and merges might be unfamiliar now, but don't worryâ€”we will learn them in this tutorial.

## Git and GitHub are Different

Git is a version control system used to track changes to your files. It is free, open-source software available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Remember, Git is software that can be installed on your computer.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It is an online platform that allows you to store and share your code with others. It is popular for developers to collaborate on projects and share code. While GitHub is one of the most popular providers of Git repositories, it is not the only one.

## A Little on Version Control Systems

Version control systems manage the history of your code. They allow you to track changes to your files and collaborate with others. Version control systems are essential for software development. Consider version control as a checkpoint in a game: you can move to any time in the game and always go back to a previous checkpoint. This is the same concept in software development.

Before Git became mainstream, developers used version control systems to manage their code. These were called SCCS (Source Code Control System). SCCS was proprietary software used to manage the history of code. It was expensive and not very user-friendly. Git was created to replace SCCS and make version control more accessible and user-friendly. Some common version control systems are Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.
