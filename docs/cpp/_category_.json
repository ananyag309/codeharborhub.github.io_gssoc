      "description": "CPP(C++) is a powerful, high-performance programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983. It extends the C language with object-oriented features, allowing for both low-level memory manipulation and high-level abstractions. C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it versatile for various applications. It is widely used in system/software development, game programming, real-time simulations, and performance-critical applications. C++ offers robust standard libraries, enabling efficient and effective code reuse. Its combination of efficiency, flexibility, and rich feature set has made it a staple in the programming world."
