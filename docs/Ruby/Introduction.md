Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented programming language that was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto (often referred to as "Matz"). It combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like object-oriented features and is known for its simplicity and readability.

Key features of Ruby include:

1. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Ruby is an object, including primitive data types like integers and booleans.

2. **Dynamic Typing**: Ruby uses dynamic typing, which means you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you create it.

3. **Mixins and Inheritance**: Ruby supports both single and multiple inheritance, as well as mixins, which allow classes to inherit features from multiple sources.

4. **Blocks and Procs**: Ruby has a powerful mechanism for handling code blocks, which are chunks of code that can be passed around and executed later.

5. **Garbage Collection**: Ruby has automatic memory management through garbage collection.

6. **Libraries and Gems**: Ruby has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, with tools like RubyGems for package management.

7. **Metaprogramming**: Ruby allows for extensive metaprogramming, meaning you can write code that writes code.

8. **Community and Rails**: Ruby on Rails, often simply called Rails, is a popular web application framework built on Ruby. It has a large and active community of developers.

Ruby's syntax emphasizes readability and simplicity, aiming to make programming more enjoyable for developers. It has been used to build a wide range of applications, from web applications to system utilities.
